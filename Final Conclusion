-	Result Analysis
The results show that the Wilcoxon rank-sum test is equivalent to stating that there is no mean or median difference in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases between group infections and non-group infections. The p-value is equal to 0.1068, and it is more than 0.05 thus, the null hypothesis is not proven. This means that the distribution of the confirmed cases in the analyzed data is not affected by the type of the infection as a group or non-group.
-Interpretation of the results
The overall findings point to the fact that the mean number of confirmed COVID-19 cases does not significantly differ between group and non-group infections, given that the p-value (0.1068) is higher than the 0.05 significance level. This indicates that the findings obtained pointed to the fact that the differentiation of the type of infection (group and non-group infection) has no impact on the number of confirmed cases. For public health strategies it means that one should pay attention not only to the etiology of the infectious disease but also to other factors such as behaviors or environmental ones which determine the further course of the pandemic.
-	Future Directions and Study Limitations
The further studies are also possible to investigate other factors which had an influence on the COVID-19 spread, including the population density, location, and the rate of the vaccination. Disadvantages encompass skewed distribution of data in addition to not taking other factors into account by narrowing focus down to the type of infection.
