The Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction was used to test the hypothesis, as it is ideal for comparing two independent groups when the data is non-normal. Since the data on confirmed COVID-19 cases does not follow a normal distribution, this non-parametric test was chosen. 
 The test evaluates whether there is a significant difference in the central tendency (location shift) between group infections and non-group infections. The result yielded W statistic of 3585 and a p-value of 0.1068, which is more than 0.05, indicating that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.
